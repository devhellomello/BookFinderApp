## BOOK FINDER ðŸ“š
This is a simple yet effective Book Finder application written in C# using the .NET Maui framework. 

### BACKGROUND
This project is the result of a course I took from Jehan Moulden to introduce beginners to Object-Oriented Programming, C#, and the .NET Maui framework. 
Jehan's course was well-paced and easy to move through. It ended with guiding the learner through created a Movie Finder App utilizing a movie database API. 
As a book lover I chose to switch it up a bit and create a Book Finder application using the Google Books API. 
I definitely struggled with some parts of developing this application but I did understand the system architecture and eventually the .NET Maui structure.
I'm not sure how much more learning I will do with .NET Maui but I would definitely like to do more work with C# and ASP.NET. 

### OVERVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT
I'm thankful that I really only had to follow Jehan's lead as she created the Movie Finder application. I had to use some different resources and code things a bit differently but I effectively let her guide me and with a bit of trial and error and ChatGPT I eventually got to a complete product. 

  1. Find a suitable API and acquire an API Key
  2. Use the API tool of your choice to verify your API endpoints. I used Bruno because I like going against the grain. ðŸ¤£
  3. Take the JSON results from your API tool and convert to C#.
  4. Take your C# results and structure your API results into the appropriate C# class structure.
  5. Write Code
  6. ....
  7. Prosper.

Kidding! But seriously I'm not well versed enoough to give you a detailed overview of the code architecture but I have written an article on Medium with as much explanation as I can provide. Please take a look if you have any questions.
